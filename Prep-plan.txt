LC 239 – Sliding Window Maximum
LC 218 – The Skyline Problem
LC 295 – Find Median from Data Stream

Monotonic Dequeue problems
1. Sliding-Window Extrema

  Pattern: Maintain a monotonic deque to get max or min in O(1) per step

  239. Sliding Window Maximum (classic max in fixed K window)

  1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average ≥ Threshold (variant: count windows by checking their min via deque)

2. Shortest ≥ K & Longest ≤ K (Prefix-Sum + Deque)

  862. Shortest Subarray with Sum ≥ K (we’ve done this)

  962. Maximum Width Ramp (same two-pass deque trick to maximize j–i with A[i] ≤ A[j])

  1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff ≤ Limit (use two deques: one increasing, one decreasing, to maintain max–min ≤ limit)

3. “At Most / At Least K” with Monotonic Two-Deque

Pattern: Two deques (or deques + count) to maintain both window max & min

  480. Sliding Window Median (hard: balance two heaps or two multisets; analogous monotonic-structure practice)

  713. Subarray Product Less Than K (two-pointer but monotonic insights help)

  992. Subarrays with K Different Integers (at-most K & at-most K−1 double-window trick)

4. Maximum-Value Equations & Prefix-Sum + Deque

  1499. Max Value of Equation (deque on transformed values y−x)

  1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query (sort by right end + min-heap/deque of left ends)

5. Advanced Prefix-Sum Counting (for contrast)

(Not deque, but good to compare)

  325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals K (hash-map of prefix sums)

  930. Binary Subarrays With Sum = S (two-pointer / prefix count)

  1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays (odd-even counting via prefix)

Suggested Practice Roadmap
  - Re-implement 862 & 962 from scratch until you can write them in 15 minutes.
  - Mix in the two-deque “max–min ≤ limit” (1438) to see how you juggle two monotonic structures.
  - Contrast with the hash-map counting problems (325, 930) to appreciate why deque only works when you only need one best window, not counts.
  - Finally, tackle 1499 (“value of equation”) to see the same deque idea applied on a transformed sequence.


Extra Arrays Practise Problem:
1. Two-Pointer on Sorted (or Nearly-Sorted) Arrays

  Pattern: move pointers inwards or outwards to find pairs/triples with a target
  Problems to try:
    11. Container With Most Water
    3Sum (and its k-Sum generalizations)
    3Sum Closest
    4Sum

2. Prefix-Sum + Hash‌‌Map for Equality/Count

  Pattern: store counts or first-occurrence of prefix sums in a map to get O(1) lookups
  Problems to try:
    560. Subarray Sum Equals K
    560 variant : Count of subarrays sum = K (just return counts)
    Continuous Subarray Sum (multiple of K)
    Count Number of Nice Subarrays (odd-even pattern)

3. Binary-Search in an Array Context

  Pattern: either search a rotated/sorted array or binary-search the answer (e.g. splitting)
  Problems to try:
    33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (with duplicates)
    Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
    Split Array Largest Sum (binary-search the max-subarray threshold)

4. DP on 1D Arrays

  Pattern: build up solutions index by index for max/min/path-count
  Problems to try:
    198. House Robber (linear DP)
    Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
    Coin Change (min-coins to make amount)
    Longest Increasing Subsequence (O(n log n) patience solution)


5. Selection & Top-K with Heaps / Quickselect

  Pattern: use a heap or in-place partition to find k-th element or top-k elements
  Problems to try:
    215. Kth Largest Element in an Array (quickselect)
    Top K Frequent Elements (heap or bucket sort)
    Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix (heap + pointers)

6. Bitwise-Xor & Masking Tricks

  Pattern: use XOR to cancel out pairs, or bit-DP to encode subsets
  Problems to try:
    136. Single Number
    Single Number III (two distinct singles)
    Single Number II (every other appears three times)
    Subarrays with Bitwise OR Equal K

7. Matrix & 2D-Prefix-Sum Extensions

  Pattern: extend prefix-sum logic into two dimensions
  Problems to try:
    363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K

Day 7 Mixed‑Hard Mock & Debrief
45 min timed set of 3 problems (one each from days 1–6).
30 min debrief: for each problem, note:
The key “aha” trick
One optimization you missed
How you’ll spot it next time


📋 Daily Debrief Template
Trick identified: e.g. “used bitmask to compress state.”
Missed optimization: e.g. “forgot to prune DFS early.”
Next‑time cue: e.g. “when constraints n≤15, think bitmask.”
