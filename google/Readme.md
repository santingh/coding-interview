**Routers**
```
We work on a network of wireless routers and define a kind of message called 
"Broadcast & Shut Down." When a router receives this message, 
it broadcasts the same message to all other routers within its wireless range. 
Then, that router shuts down, and can no longer send or receive messages.

Given a list of routers' locations (their names and the corresponding 2D coordinates), 
tell me whether a message from Router A can reach Router B. 
Write a method / function with appropriate input and output arguments.
