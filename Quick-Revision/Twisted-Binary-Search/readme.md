# Tricky Binary Search Practice Problems

Below are four LeetCode problems that involve non-trivial binary search patterns—some search on the answer space, others on a transformed array or predicate.

1. **410 (“Split Array Largest Sum”): Binary‐search on possible max‐subarray‐sum, check with a linear scan.**  
2. **1011 (“Capacity to Ship Packages”): Almost the same pattern—binary‐search on ship capacity, greedy simulate shipments.**  
3. **719 (“K-th Smallest Pair Distance”): Binary‐search on distance, count pairs ≤ mid using two pointers.**  
4. **154 (“Min in Rotated Array”): Binary‐search on the rotated sorted array using a simple midpoint‐vs‐endpoint comparison.**
