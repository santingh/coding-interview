 1. **2-d Array Coordinates to Intger**


    id = (row * colCount + col); 
    row = id / colCount;
    col  = id % colCount;


2. **int to char and char to int**

   int n = cArray[i] - '0';
   cArray[i] = (char) (n2 + '0');


3. **Stack Usage**

   process of storing elements and then walking back through them matches the behavior of a stack.
