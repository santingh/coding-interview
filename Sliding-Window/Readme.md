# Sliding-Window Patterns

### Fixed-Size Window
- Slide a window of size k to compute sums, max/min, averages.  
  _e.g._ “Max sum of any subarray of length k.” or "Subarrays of Size k and Average ≥ Threshold (LeetCode 1343)"


Use below techniques for variable length window. 

### Non-Monotonic Metric

#### Exactly K – O(n)
- Prefix-Sum + HashMap  
- `map.get(sum - k)`  
- `map.put(sum)`

#### At Most K – O(n log n)
- Prefix-Sum + TreeMap  
- `sum(map.tailMap(sum - k).values())`
- Usecase: count subarrays

#### At Least K – O(n log n)
- Prefix-Sum + TreeMap  
- `sum(map.headMap(sum - k).values())`  
- or `(totalSubarrays - atMost(K-1))`

### Monotonic Metric

#### Exactly K – O(n)
- `atMost(K) - atMost(K-1)`

#### At Most K – O(n)
- Sliding-window + two pointers

#### At Least K – O(n)
- `(totalSubarrays - atMost(K-1))`

### Monotonic Deque
1. Sliding-window max/min  
2. “Shortest ≥ K” or “Longest ≤ K” style prefix-sum problems  
3. Any time you need the best candidate at the window’s front, and adding/removing preserves a single-direction order

### Min-Window Substring
- Find the smallest window containing all required chars.  
  _e.g._ LC 76 “Minimum Window Substring.”

### All-Permutations in String
- Check a sliding window for anagram match via freq-arrays.  
  _e.g._ LC 438 “Find All Anagrams in a String.”

### Longest/Shortest Substring with Constraints
- _e.g._ “Longest substring with at most K distinct,” “Longest without repeating.”

### Sum/Avg under Constraint
- _e.g._ “Max average subarray of length ≥ k.”

### Window with Dynamic Condition
- _e.g._ “Fruit into baskets” (at most 2 distinct), “Binary subarrays with sum = S.”

# Two-Pointer Patterns

### Pair-Sum in Sorted Array
- Move left/right inward based on sum vs. target.  
  _e.g._ LC 167 “Two Sum II.”

### Container With Most Water
- l/r maximize area → move smaller inward.  
  _e.g._ LC 11

### 3-Sum / 4-Sum
- Fix one (or two) pointers, use two-pointer for the remainder.  
  _e.g._ LC 15 “3Sum.”

### Dutch National Flag / Partition
- Three pointers to sort 0/1/2 or partition by pivot.  
  _e.g._ LC 75 “Sort Colors.”

### In-Place Removal / Duplication
- Overwrite unwanted values as you scan with two pointers.  
  _e.g._ LC 26 “Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.”

### Merging Sorted Arrays
- Tail-to-head merge with two pointers.  
  _e.g._ “Merge two sorted lists/arrays.”

### Linked List Fast & Slow
- Find middle / detect cycle / remove nth from end.  
  _e.g._ LC 876 “Middle of the Linked List,” LC 142 “Cycle II.”

### Reversal
- Reverse array/string in-place by swapping `l++`, `r--`.  
  _e.g._ “Reverse Words in a String.”

---

# Kadane’s & Extensions

### Classic Kadane’s
- `currentMax = max(num, currentMax + num)` → global max.  
  _e.g._ LC 53 “Maximum Subarray.”

### Max Product Subarray
- Keep both min/max at each step (sign flips).  
  _e.g._ LC 152

### Circular Subarray Sum
- `max(standardKadane, totalSum - minSubarray)`.  
  _e.g._ LC 918 “Max Circular Subarray.”

### One Deletion Allowed
- DP with two states: with/without deletion.  
  _e.g._ LC 1186 “Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion.”

### Max Average Subarray
- Binary-search on answer + sliding-window check.  
  _e.g._ “Max average subarray of length ≥ k.”

### Max Sum with Constraints
- Combine Kadane’s with deque for windowed constraints.  
  _e.g._ LC 1425 “Constrained Subsequence Sum.”

## Suggested Practice Roadmap

- Re-implement LC 862 & 962 from scratch until you can write them in 15 minutes.  
- Mix in the two-deque “max–min ≤ limit” (LC 1438) to juggle two monotonic structures.  
- Contrast with hash-map counting problems (LC 325, 930) to see why deque only works for “max/min” not counts.  
- Finally, tackle LC 1499 (“Max Value of Equation”) to apply the deque idea on a transformed sequence.
